## Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rhobin! 
I am a DevOps engineer at [Dyson](https://www.dyson.com/en) that brings software automated solutions to the business.
<br />
A certified AWS Solutions Architect Associate.
****
#### Interests ðŸ‘€ 
I am interested in architectural designs of a software organization specifically in AWS infrastructure and containerization management.
The tools I use are docker and kubernetes to build and deploy applications to on-prem or cloud.
I am also a python enthusiast and it has been my programming language for 6 years (and counting).

****
#### Things I've been up to ðŸŒ± 
These days, I am expanding my devops knowledge through self-taught trainings and certifications.
I have been experimenting new things I learned from the courses then utilizing them to my work and to my personal projects.
At the same time, it helped me passed certification exams.
